These will be added to release notes when the release is made. This page
only holds bug fixes and other minor tweaks: anything larger is covered by
[Inform evolution](https://github.com/ganelson/inform-evolution) proposals.

## Featurettes arising from bug reports, but too small for Inform Evolution proposals

- External files are now stored as UTF-8 encoded Unicode, rather than ISO Latin-1,
	extending the range of characters they can store, and meaning that they can
	hold anything Inform stories can print. See [PR#192](https://github.com/ganelson/inform/pull/192).

- This was reported as Jira bug [I7-2087](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2087)
	"three anonymous standard rules", but is arguably a feature request: that three
	rules in the Standard Rules should have names. All three are simple rules, two
	of them occurring early and late in the turn cycle to consider whether a scene
	change has happened, and one as the fallback rule making an action succeed if
	no rules have intervened in the process.
	```
	early scene changing stage
	late scene changing stage
	default action success rule
	```

- Similarly: see Jira bug [I7-2556](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2556)
	```
	very likely to mean taking off what's currently worn rule
	```

- In past builds it caused some surprise that `[regarding...]` did not affect
	`[s]`, the text substitution which adds an "s" if the last thing(s) discussed
	are plurally named. This was reported as [I7-2605](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2605).
	That behaviour was correct as documented, but rather than dismiss the bug report
	it seemed more helpful to implement this implied feature request. So:
	```
	"the [regarding the number of animals in the crate]animal[s] in the crate"
	```
	now prints "animals", plural, if the number is 0 or at least 2, and "animal", singular,
	if there's just one in the crate.

- Three previously unindexed phrases used by the Standard Rules but not documented
    have now been brought out into the open: `yes` and `no` as aliases for
    `decide yes` and `decide no` in the body of phrases to decide if some
    condition holds; and `if substituting text for comparison purposes`, which
    was previously called `if expanding text for comparison purposes`, but has
    been renamed for consistency with the existing `substituted form of` phrase,
    to which it's related. This condition is true when text is being printed
    (so that various activities to do with, say, printing names will fire), but
    only internally in order to make a comparison between texts, and not on
    screen. That can be useful to avoid side-effects happening when they
    shouldn't: see for example the `make named things mentioned rule` in the
    Standard Rules, which is the only place it uses this phrase.

- The humble business of printing the "banner" for a story, that is, text like:
	```
	Dreams of the Occident
	An Interactive Fiction
	Release 3 / Serial Number 260415 / Inform 7 v10.2.0
	```
	has been reimplemented in Inform source text. In particular, the new
	```
	standard printing the banner text rule
	```
	is the default arrangement: lines 1 to 3 above are responses `(A)` to `(C)`
	for this rule. See Jira bug
	[I7-2686](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2686).

- Correspondingly, the `announce the story file version rule`, which provides
	the default implementation of the `VERSION` command, has been rewritten as
	Inform source text, and its output is slightly tidier:
	```
	>VERSION
	Dreams of the Occident
	An Interactive Fiction
	Release 3 / Serial Number 260415 / Inform 7 v10.2.0+6X96
	Identification number: A7A885DC-1187-4D85-9550-F2DC02B2BD90
	Interpreter version 0.6.0 / VM 3.1.3

	There are no copyright acknowledgements for extensions used by this story.
	```
	Note that that last sentence, the output from `COPYRIGHT` in this case,
	is the new response `(A)` of the `announce the copyright licences rule`;
	it is printed if every extension compiled into the story has `Use authorial modesty`
	specified, so that the author is waiving the credit.

- The above was handled with four new bibliographic variables, which are read-only:
	```
	story serial code
	project IFID
	Inform version number
	Inform build code
	```

- There is a new use option
	```
	Use project IFID of "...".
	```
	which sets the IFID. If the project already has a `uuid.txt` file, then the
	Use option value takes precedence over that, but a warning is issued
	(unless the `uuid.txt` sets the same IFID, tested case insensitively, or
	the `uuid.txt` file sets the IFID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`,
	a special value reserved for testing). See Jira bug
	[I7-2629](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2629).

- Two new bibliographic variables now exist: `story serial code` and `project IFID`.
	These are read-only, and are automatically set by Inform at compile time.
	```
	say "Hmm, the bar code in the lining of my jacket reads [project IFID].";
	```

- When releasing a story with a website, and a cover image which has alt-text
	provided, that text is now used on the thumbnail cover images in the website.
	(See Jira bug [I7-2615](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2615): the
	lack of this feature could very fairly have been called a bug.)

- Errors occurring in I6-syntax code, either in `(- ... -)` inclusions into I7
	source text or in kit source code, are now reported more fully, with source
	references and links provided. (A feature request for this was filed as
	Jira bug [I7-2232](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2232).)

- The obscure debugging verb TREE has been renamed SHOWTREE to reduce the risk
	of confusion when "tree" is typed in reply to a clarifying question from the
	command parser, in a debug build (such as in the app). See
	Jira bug [I7-2398](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2398). Its output
	has also been modernised so that it gives a clearer picture of the model
	world, and in particular, covers incorporation. See  See Jira bug
	[I7-2424](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2424).

- The transcript file is, in Glulx, now written as UTF-8 text. See
	Jira bug [I7-2516](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2516).

- The Inform 6 compiler's built-in pseudofunction "random()" can now be replaced. See
	Jira bug [I7-2435](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2435).

- Inform 7 now optimises compilation so that code to parse command text for kinds
	is only generated if command grammar involving those kinds actually exists.
	This makes little difference to eventual code size because the Inform 6
	compiler would have removed those functions anyway, but it does reduce
	dictionary word usage. Typically, it means about 120 words fewer in the
	story file dictionary: only a trivial memory saving, but it avoids some
	warnings due to dictionary entry clashes. See Jira bug (really a suggestion)
	[I7-2573](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2573).

## Gender neutrality

"Writing with Inform" and "The Recipe Book" benefit from a revision throughout to
remove unnecessary gender-binary language, mostly to do with pronouns attached
to "the player", or similar. The example `Blue or Pink` has become `Good or Evil`,
and now poses a moral rather than gender-based question.

The little-used rule:

	player aware of his own actions rule

has been renamed:

	player aware of their own actions rule

## Phase-out of (+ ... +)

Since the earliest days of Inform 7, the notation `(+` ... `+)` has needed to
be used, at least occasionally, inside Inform 6-syntax matter in order to refer
back to things which could only be described with source text. So, where `(-` ... `-)`
allowed source text to drop down into C-like code in Inform 6 syntax, `(+` ... `+)`
within that C-level code allowed a climb back up into natural language.

This was always troublesome, and for some years _Writing with Inform_ has warned
that it should be used only as a last resort, and that it would some day likely
be phased out. That has turned out to be true, and this is that day.

Use of `(+` ... `+)` continues to work, but generates a warning message, which
provides a documentation link to the new facilities which replace it. In the
next major release, any use of `(+` ... `+)` will throw a problem message,
not a warning.

## Language kit changes to article-handling

A low-level change to Inform's system for printing in natural languages at
runtime will affect anybody translating Inform to write stories in languages
other than English, so we're flagging it up here. It was always an anomaly
that the `LanguageArticles` array (defined in `EnglishLanguageKit`, but other
language kits would have to define it too) had slots for the capitalised
definite, uncapitalised definite, and uncapitalised indefinite articles —
but not the capitalised indefinite, which Inform instead attempted to
synthesize by printing to an array and then capitalising the first word. That
worked most of the time, but caused problems with rules written for the
`printing the name of` activity, which was being called twice over. This has
long been a nuisance, as the existence of extensions like `Indefinite Article Substitution Fix`
by Matt Weiner and `Print Stage Detection` by Taryn Michelle go to show.

`LanguageArticles` now has a slot for capitalised indefinite articles, and
this is all more consistent. See Jira bug [I7-2138](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2138)
for more on why we've done this, and see [PR#190](https://github.com/ganelson/inform/pull/190)
for more on how.

## Version updates

The Inform repository (and thus its released app) includes a few resources by
external developers, which are periodically updated. In this release:

- The Quixe web-based interpreter has been updated to version 2.2.6.
- The embedded copy of Inform 6 has been updated to an unstable version 6.45,
	and we expect this to be replaced by release 6.45 when the latter is ready.

## Cosmetic fixes

These affect documentation, or the wording of problem messages or the Index, but
do not really change the compiler or other tools in any way which changes how
source text is read.

## Bugs fixed but not from tracked reports

- Fix for a "very old quirk of I7 where it generates a `story.gblorb.js` file for
	the interpreter website, but the filename is a lie. It's the base64-encoding
	of the `story.ulx` file, not the `story.gblorb`." (Andrew Plotkin, not from Jira)
- "X is an activity on nothing" would incorrectly create an activity on objects,
	resulting in an immediate contradiction. (Activities on nothing are not often
	useful, which is why this bug has lasted so long.)
- "empty", as an adjective, was defined only on activities and rulebooks based
	on objects

## Bugs fixed in the course of feature additions

Work done on Inform evolution proposal [(IE-0015) World model enforcement](https://github.com/ganelson/inform-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0015-world-model-enforcement.md)
fixes a number of known anomalies in the way that the standard world model
handled containment, incorporation and so on. This enabled a number of bugs to
be closed:

- [I7-2296](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2296)
	on things being privately-named causing their printed names not to be used in room description
- [I7-2220](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2220)
	on the definition of holding
- [I7-2219](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2219)
	on directions being held
- [I7-2178](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2178)
	on "if x is held by a supporter" resulting in false negative
- [I7-2158](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2158)
	on "all" determiner tests failing with relations
- [I7-2128](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2128)
	on holding relation tests failing for containment, support, or incorporation
- [I7-2046 = Mantis 2083](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2046)
	on when containers holding concealed items say they are "(empty)"
- [I7-2036 = Mantis 2073](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2036)
	on inconsistencies when containers or supporters holding concealed items are examined

Similarly, [(IE-0021) No automatic plural synonyms](https://github.com/ganelson/inform-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0021-no-automatic-plural-synonyms.md):

- [I7-1980 = Mantis 2016](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-1980)
	on understanding things by plural name of kind

Similarly, [(IE-0042) Release along with separated resources](https://github.com/ganelson/inform-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0042-release-separated-resources.md):

- [I7-2679](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2679)
	on smuggling `.mp3` sound files through the Release mechanism

Similarly, [(IE-0043) Improved comparatives and superlatives](https://github.com/ganelson/inform-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0043-improved-comparatives-and-superlatives.md):

- [I7-2595](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2595)
	on comparatives/superlatives on a scene leading to problems or run-time errors

## Note about intest

- On MacOS, `intest` is supplied inside the app for testing examples in the
	documentation of extension projects: a bug has been fixed which caused the
	test scripts in such examples to be wrongly extracted if characters appeared
	after the final double-quote of the test script (for example, any redundant
	white space). This isn't strictly speaking a core Inform bug fix, but it
	affects some users.
