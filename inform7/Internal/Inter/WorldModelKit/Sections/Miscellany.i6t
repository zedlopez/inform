@h Global Variables.
These are not the only global variables defined in the template layer:
those needed locally only by single sections (and not used in definitions
of phrases in the Standard Rules, or referred to by Inform directly) are defined
within those sections -- they can be regarded as unimportant implementation
details, subject to change at whim. The variables here, on the other hand,
are more important to understand.

(1) The first three variables to be defined are special in that they are
significant to very early-style Z-machine interpreters, where they are
used to produce the status line display (hence |sline1| and |sline2|).

(2) The |say__*| are used for the finite state machine used in printing
text, which keeps track of automatic paragraph breaking and the like. For
details see the "Printing.i6t" section.

(3) |standard_interpreter| is used only for the Z-machine VM, and is always
0 for Glulx. For Z, a non-zero value here is the version number of the
{\it Z-Machine Standards Document} which the interpreter claims to support,
in the form (upper byte).(lower). |undo_flag|, similarly, behaves slightly
differently on the two platforms according to whether they support multiple
consecutive UNDOs. UNDO basically works by taking memory snapshots of the
whole VM ("saving UNDO") to revert to at a later point ("performing UNDO"),
so it is expensive on memory, and traditional VMs can only store a single
memory snapshot -- making two UNDOs in a row, going back two steps,
impossible. Given this, |undo_flag| has three possible states: 0 means
UNDO is not available at all, 1 means it is not available now because
there is no further saved state to go back to from here, and 2 means it
is available.

(4) |deadflag| in normally 0, or false, meaning play continues; 1 means the
game ended in death; 2 for ended in victory; higher numbers represent
exotic endings. (As from May 2010, the use of 2 for victory is deprecated,
and a separate flag, |story_complete|, records whether the story is
"complete" in the sense that we don't expect the player to replay.)
|deadflag| switching state normally triggers an end to rulebook processing,
so is the single most important global variable to the running of a story
file.

(5) At present, |time_rate| is not made use of in I7: if positive, it is
the number of minutes which pass each turn; if negative, the number of
turns which pass each minute. This is quite a neat way to approximate a
wide range of time steps with an integer such that fractions are exact
and we can approximate any duration to a fair accuracy (the worst case
being $3/4$ minute, where we have to choose between 1 minute or $1/2$
minute).

(6) Note that |notify_mode| is irrelevant if the use option "Use no scoring"
is in force: it isn't looked at, and can't be changed, and shouldn't have
an effect anyway since |score| will never be altered.

(7) |player| is a variable, not a constant, since the focus of play can
change. |SACK_OBJECT| is likewise an unexpected variable: in the I6
library, there could only be one player's holdall, a single rucksack-like
possession which had to be the value of the constant |SACK_OBJECT|. Here we
define |SACK_OBJECT| as a global variable instead, the value of which is
the player's holdall currently in use. |visibility_ceiling| is the
highest object in the tree visible from the player's point of view:
usually the room, but sometimes nothing (in darkness), and sometimes a
closed non-transparent container.

(8) See "OrderOfPlay.i6t" for the meaning of action variables.

(9) This is a slate of global variables used by the parser to give some
context to the general parsing routines (GPRs) which it calls; in the I6
design, any object can provide its own GPR, in the form of a |parse_name|
property. GPRs are in effect parser plug-ins, and I7 makes extensive use
of them.

(10) Similarly, variables for the parser to give context to another sort
of plug-in routine: a scope filter. I7 uses these too.

(11) The |move_*| variables are specific to the |##Going| action.

(12) These variables hold current settings for listing objects and,
more elaborately, performing room descriptions.

(13) The current colour scheme is stored in variables in order that it can
be saved in the save game state, and changed correctly on an UNDO: if it
were a transient state inside the VM interpreter's screen model, then a
RESTORE or UNDO will upset what the original author may have intended the
appearance of text in particular scenes to be. (Cf. Adam Cadre's I6 patch
|L61007|.)

(14) These pixel dimensions are used both for the Glulx and v6 Z-machines,
but not for the more commonly used versions 5 or 8, whose screen model is
based on character cells.

@h Compass.
I6 identified compass directions as being children of the pseudo-object
|Compass|, so we define it. (Note that |Compass| is not a valid I7 object,
and is used for no other purpose.) Because of the traditional structure
of language definitions, this needs to come first.

=
Object Compass "compass";

@h Score and Rankings Table.
The following command tells Inform to compile constant definitions for |INITIAL_MAX_SCORE|
and/or |RANKING_TABLE|, in cases where there are scores and rankings. If there's
no ranking table, |RANKING_TABLE| is left undefined, so that we can |#ifdef| this
possibility later.

=
Global MAX_SCORE = INITIAL_MAX_SCORE;
